Status Properties Design (7/7/16)
---------------------------------
The current implemention of Status Percentages doesn't suit our needs for two reasons:

1. Entities can be affected for different numbers of turns for different StatusEffects.
The current implemention doesn't allow us to influence the duration of the StatusEffect.
2. If it needs to change later, it'll be a pain

It'll be best if we do a similar approach to what we did with MiscProperties.

Implementation
--------------
Rename the current StatusPercentages dictionary to "StatusProperties."

Define a new immutable struct called StatusPropertyHolder:

struct StatusPropertyHolder
{
    public int StatusPercentage { get; private set; }
    public int AdditionalTurns { get; private set; }
}

Now we can hold both the percentage and the duration. The duration will be relative to the StatusEffect's base
Duration. For example, say a Sleepy Sheep inflicts Sleep for 3 turns. Enemies more susceptible to Sleep like Bowser
can have AdditionalTurns be 4 for Sleep, thus making Sleep last for 7 turns total on him. Negative values will also be
supported so entities can be less susceptible to certain StatusEffects.

If we need to add anything else later, we can easily put them in the struct and be able to access them right away.
