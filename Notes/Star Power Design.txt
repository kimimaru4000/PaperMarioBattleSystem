Star Power Design (11/5/16)
---------------------------
Specifics about how TTYD's Star Power works was found from Jdaster64's Super Mario Files blog:
https://supermariofiles.wordpress.com/2013/01/19/now-youre-playing-with-star-power/

Each circle of Star Power is represented as 100 Star Power units (SPU). So half of one Star Power circle is 50 SPU.

The max SPU you can obtain in TTYD is 800, as there are 7 Crystal Stars and the Magical Map grants the first Star Power, Sweet Treat.

For Appealing, the calculation is as follows:

SPU gained = 25 * (number of Super Appeals (P) + 1) + (number of active audience) / 4

So for Appealing, the types of audience members don't matter, but "active" audience members means that they can't be sleeping or unable
to participate in any way.

For attacks, it goes like this:

SPU gained = floor(sqrt(Audience Value) * (Action Command Value) * (Danger Status) * (BINGO Status)).

All ACTIVE audience members are worth 1 point, with the exceptions being Toads, which are worth 3, and Dull Bones, which are worth 0.
The total audience value is the sum of all the audience members' individual values.

Danger Status (Partner>5 HP)  (Partner<=5 HP) (Partner<= 1 HP)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Mario>5 HP          1.0             1.5             2.0
Mario<=5 HP         2.0             3.0             4.0
Mario at 1 HP       3.0             4.5             6.0

The BINGO value defaults to 1 and changes for a few turns after a BINGO, indicated while the Audience is jumping up and down.
Mushroom, Flower, and Star BINGOs set the BINGO value to 2, and Shine Sprite BINGOs set the value to 3.


Star Spirits Star Power
-----------------------
We can also represent the Star Power in PM the same way. Gaining Star Power is simple in PM, as it adds a set amount each turn, at the start of the phase cycle.

The max SPU you can obtain in PM is 700, as there are 7 Star Spirits.

Each turn, you get 12.5 SPU (8 turns for 100, a full bar).

Focus, without any Deep Focus badges, grants 50 SPU, or half a bar.

With 1 Deep Focus badge, 75, or 3/4 of a bar.
With 2 Deep Focus badges, 100, or a full bar.
With 3 Deep Focus badges, 125, or 1 and 1/4 bars.

Each Deep Focus badge adds an additional 25 SPU gained to the Focus command.
