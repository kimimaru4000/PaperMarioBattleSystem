Enemy Information (3/13/17)
---------------------------

Winged Enemies
--------------
-When inflicted with a status, Winged enemies use their own status tables rather than their grounded variants. This includes when you jump on them

Ice Puffs
---------
-Have a Heal Resistance to Ice
-Have a contact exception to Ice

Frost Piranha
-------------
-Have a Heal Resistance to Ice
-No contact exception to Ice

Stilt Guys
----------
-Fall off when being inflicted with any type of Immobilized status, such as Paralyzed or Dizzy (in PM)
-Fall off when jumped on, turning into normal Shy Guys
-Also fall off when hit with Quake Hammer

Shy Squad
---------
-Counts as a single enemy
-Has 15 HP, with each Shy Guy representing 1 HP
  -When damaged, the number of Shy Guys correlating to the amount of damage are removed from the squad (Ex. 4 damage means 4 Shy Guys are removed)
-Number of times they attack correlates to how many there are in the Squad (Max = 15, Min = 1)

Shy Stack
---------
-Counts as a single enemy
-All Shy Guys share and use the same animations simultaneously
-Battle position is the topmost Shy Guy
-Attack power correlates to how many there are on the stack (Max Attack = 4, Min Attack = 1)
-Can knock off the bottom-most Shy Guy with Spin Smash. If successful, will knock off the one it hits into as well
-Can also knock off the bottom-most Shy Guy with Kooper's Shell moves
-If all but one are knocked off, still act like a Shy Stack and deal 1 damage

Cleft
-----
-Flipped over with an explosion (TTYD) for 2 turns. When flipped, Defense goes to 0. After the turns are up, it gets back up
  -Its base Defense likely stays the same and its Defense modifier is subtracted by its base Defense to equal 0. Defense-boosting
   and Defense-lowering effects still apply while it's flipped
-Explosive Payback with Hold Fast does not cause them to flip over

Bristle
-------
-Pops its spikes out when approached with a move. Moves include Hammer, Gulp, or anything that gets near.
-Having Spike Shield equipped allows Mario to approach them with Hammer
-Flipped over with an explosion. Spikes on the bottom still protect it from jumps, and spikes on the side still prevent it from being approached
  -Also flipped over with Quake Hammer and a POW Block
  -However, an Earth Quake does NOT flip them over
-Not flipped with Explosive Payback via Hold Fast
-When Immobilized, spikes don't pop out, allowing them to be approached
  -Same with Frozen and Sleep
  -Interestingly, same with Confusion and Dizzy!
-When their spikes don't pop out due to immobilization or similar status effects, they're still spiky, as Ms. Mowz' Kiss Thief won't work but
 Mario's Hammer and Yoshi's Gulp do
-Asleep for 5 turns
-Like jumping on spiked enemies, their side spikes will still damage you if you're Invisible
-Koops can attack them without their spikes interrupting him with his shell moves

Paragoomba
----------
-In PM, loses wings when hit with the Hammer from a First Strike

Flipped Enemies (Koopa Troopas, Clefts, Bristles)
-------------------------------------------------
-They are immune to Fright when flipped, as they can't run away

Electro Blooper
---------------
-When it electrifies itself, it doesn't gain the Electrified status but directly applies the Electrified physical attribute instead
-Any move that damages it gets rid of its Electrified physical attribute when it electrifies itself

Blooper Baby
------------
-Despite being spawned by Super Blooper, they both go before him

Lakitu
------
-When inflicted with Dizzy in TTYD, they drop any Spiny Eggs they're holding

Lava Piranha
------------
-When it misses with its main fireball move, the fireball doesn't show up and little fire particles show up instead.
-Can be hit by Quake Hammer

Huff N' Puff
------------
When he misses with his damaging air move where he blows at you, you're not required to perform the Action Command involving mashing A.

Yux, Z-Yux, X-Yux
----------------- 
They can still take damage from Status Effects such as Poison, Burn, and Frozen if they have a shield up.

Creating a Mini happens at the end of the enemy phase, before Bobbery's Bombs go off but after Status Effects.

If they don't move for a turn (via Immobilized, Slow, or another Status Effect that prevents movement), they will not create a Mini at the end of their phases. However,
if they just recovered from this condition, they will still create a Mini. 

-Minis don't take turns

Mini Counts:
-Yux: 2 (+1 per turn)
-Z-Yux: 4 (+1 per turn)
-X-Yux: 4 (+2 per turn)

Grodus
------
-You can attack his staff with many single-hit moves that attack various heights, such as Jump
  -It cannot be targeted or hit by most multi-hit moves, Art Attack or most moves with secondary targets (Ex. Tornado Jump)
-Can be targeted and hit by Fire Drive
-His staff does not have HP. When it's attacked, it causes his next spell to fail.

-If you use Bomb Squad and a Bobbery Bomb kills a Grodus X, it will adjust the formation or add more Grodus Xs before the next Bobbery Bomb goes
  -This does not apply if the Bobbery Bomb blew another one up. The other Bobbery Bombs that got hit by the explosion will detonate before carrying out the Grodus X events

Grodus X
--------
-Add +1 Defense to Grodus (+1 per turn; max of 4)
-With a max of 4, they make Grodus invincible
-They attack with Zap, which does 4 damage

Gulpits' Rocks
--------------
-Have 1 HP; dealing 0 damage on them doesn't have any effect
-They don't display their HP even after being Tattled or if the Peekaboo Badge is equipped

-Can't be targeted by multi-hit moves and items, and they aren't hit/affected by them either
-Can't be targeted by any single-hit item (Ex. Egg Missile)

-Can't be targeted by Electro Dash or Power Shock
-Can't be targeted by Squirt
-Can't be targeted by Spiny Flip
-Can't be targeted by Hammer Throw

-Spin Smash can't destroy the rocks with the Action Command, and the rocks don't get knocked into each other like enemies do.
Hitting a rock with a failed Spin Smash causes it to spin and get destroyed.

Goomnut Tree
------------
-It doesn't display its HP even after being Tattled or if the Peekaboo Badge is equipped; the battle scripts say it's at Level 1 with -1 HP.

-Can't be targeted by multi-hit moves and items, and isn't hit/affected by them either

-When hit by Mario or his Partner, a big Goomnut deals 3 damage to the Goomba King, Red Goomba, and Blue Goomba. The Goomnut disappears and the tree cannot be hit again afterwards.
-When the Goomba King stomps, three small Goomnuts deal 2 damage to Mario. The Goomnuts disappear and the Goomba King cannot use this move afterwards.

Crystal King
------------
-If you use Mega Shock and paralyze him, his Crystal Bits will go away even though they're not affected by it. This will need more testing to be confirmed.
-The same happens if you use Time Out to immobilize him and it doesn't affect the Crystal Bits.

Crystal Bits
------------
-All have a 0% chance of being inflicted by any Status Effect. This includes: 

-Spook and Hurricane (their percentages are the same in the battle scripts)
-Up & Away (not possible normally, since beating the Crystal King gives you this move)
-Air Lift

X-Nauts (the ones with Lord Crump in Chapter 5; aka X-Naut Platoon
------------------------------------------------------------------
-Can hold Fire Flowers

Dark Puff
---------
-When charged with Electricity, contact is a Failure instead of a Partial Success
  -If inflicted with Electrified (via cheats), however, contact is a Partial Success. But if both charged and Electrified, it's a Failure
  -Regardless if it has Electrified or is charged with electricity, being Electrified yourself (via Zap Tap or a Volt Shroom) will be a Successful contact

Poison Puff
-----------
-When charged with Poison and attacked directly, deals half the damage dealt to it and poisons the character that hit it
  -If inflicted with Electrified, adds +1 to the damage dealt, like with normal Payback, but does not do this if the attacker is also Electrified

Lava Bubble
-----------
-When Electrified, with Payback and Hold Fast, it will deal only 1 damage if Mario attacks it without Zap Tap or Ice Power
  -If Mario attacks it with Ice Power, it deals Full payback damage + 1 from Electrified

------------
-If hit by Payback (via Return Postage or other means) when attacking, it will drain FP but won't restore it

Duplighost
----------
-When transformed as a Partner, the power of their attacks is determined by the real Partner's rank
-If transformed, will transform back into a Duplighost when hit by Electric damage or inflicted with Paralyzed
  -The Electric damage includes Thunder Bolt and Thunder Rage, and Electric payback from a Volt Shroom or Zap Tap

Lantern
-------
-When hit, illuminates the radius around it
-It takes two hits to be able to target the Big Lantern Ghost that's holding it
-Four hits on it fully lights up the room

-Has the Lantern light attack that shines to deal 2 damage to Mario and his Partner
  -This attack does not put out the Lantern
-Is considered the back enemy. Attempting to Hammer will let you target only its Lantern

Fuzzipede
