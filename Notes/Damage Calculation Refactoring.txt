Damage Calculation Refactoring (3/10/17)
----------------------------------------
Right now both following and changing the damage formula is cumbersome. Changing one thing can lead to an inaccuracy
not present before unless the change is looked over very carefully.

So the aim of this is the following:

1. Split the damage calculation into parts to allow for flexibility with regards to swapping parts
   and the mathematical operations - no having to look up 20+ lines for the value of something referenced way later
2. Preserve the values of each part after their calculations are done for easy reference
3. A flexible data structure to store the parts in that defines their order
4. Make adding new parts extremely easy

None of this should be exposed outside of the Interactions class, at least not yet. Interactions handles the damage calculation
and there's no reason for anything else to call just one or two parts of the damage calculation.
