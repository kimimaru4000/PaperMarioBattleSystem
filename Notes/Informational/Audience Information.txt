Audience Information (5/3/17)
-----------------------------
Here's where we'll document information about the Audience.

The Audience is rather complex and hasn't been completely figured out yet to my knowledge. I will do some testing, specifically in regards to Audience growth,
behavior, and events around them.

List of known Audience events:
-Crazee Dayzees putting the Audience to sleep
-Bulky Bob-ombs blowing up and taking out a portion of the Audience around them
-Koopa Troopas in the audience hide into their shells, staying but giving no SP
-Boos turning a character invisible for 1 turn
-Shy Guys jumping onstage and triggering random stage events
-Punies fleeing when hearing certain loud noises
-Piranha plants eating nearby audience members
-X-Nauts teaming up with other X-Nauts to throw rocks (these rocks deal 3 damage)
-Water spilling onto the Audience, causing all Punies to run away

I'll eventually look into what conditions cause these events to occur via Dolphin's debugger.

Additional Info
---------------
-When testing to see if Allergic prevents you from using Power Lift, I afflicted a Hyper Spiky Goomba with Allergic. Interestingly, when it charged and failed to
inflict itself with the status, some members of the Audience left. This happened two times in a row so it wasn't a one-off thing. Considering this had literally nothing
to do with any player action, it gives a bit more insight into how this system works.
