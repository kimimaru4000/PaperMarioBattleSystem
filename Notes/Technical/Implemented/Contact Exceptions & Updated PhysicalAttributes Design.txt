Updated PhysicalAttributes
--------------------------
Currently PhysicalAttributes are stored in each BattleEntity like so:

Dictionary<PhysicalAttributes, bool> PhysAttributes;

The bool value is completely unused and thus redundant. Normally this is fine,
but there's a problem when having different sources apply and remove the same
PhysicalAttribute. This will be discussed further in the Contact Exceptions section,
as it applies here too.

In short, make the value an integer. When a PhysicalAttribute is added, increment
the value or add the entry in the Dictionary depending on whether it was already
present in the Dictionary or not. When removing a PhysicalAttribute, decrement
the value and completely remove the key if the new value is <= 0. This solves
all conflicts with different sources applying the same PhysicalAttribute because
we can safely remove it without completely eliminating the attribute on a still-active
source.

Contact Exceptions
------------------
Currently contact exceptions are determined based on MiscProperties. This is no good,
and the example below will explain why.

There are two Badges in the Paper Mario series that grant the ability to jump on
Fiery enemies: Ice Power, and Fire Shield. Say we equipped both Badges, and each one
applied the JumpFieryEntity MiscProperty. All is fine right now...then we remove
the Fire Shield Badge. This will remove the JumpFieryEntity MiscProperty, preventing
Mario from jumping on a Fiery enemy, but we still have the Ice Power Badge equipped!

Solution
--------
Here's how we can fix this problem:

Add a Dictionary<ContactTypes, List<PhysicalAttribute>> called ContactExceptions to BattleEntity.
When adding an exception, simply add a PhysicalAttribute to the list. It may seem redundant to
have more than one of the same PhysicalAttribute in the list, but it helps us track them from all sources.

So in the example above, we'd add Fiery to the list under the JumpContact key each time either Ice Power or
Fire Shield is equipped. This would cause the list to look like: (Fiery, Fiery)

When we unequip Fire Shield, The list would just be: (Fiery). This is what we want because though we
unequipped Fire Shield, Ice Power is still active AND Mario can still jump on Fire enemies!

This is also a more scalable solution for this type of thing than MiscProperties, which are meant to be small
unique properties that are specific.

More Applications
-----------------
We can extend this sort of thing to Evasion, Accuracy, and more so the correct values are always preserved.
