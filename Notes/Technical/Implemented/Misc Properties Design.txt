Misc Properties Design (7/6/16)
-------------------------------

What they are
-------------
Misc Properties are unrelated properties that BattleEntities can have.

Examples include:
-Chance of being frightened away from battle
-Chance of being blown or lifted away from battle
-Chance of being hit by an Instant KO move
-Whether the BattleEntity is immune to StatusEffects or not

Implementation
--------------
We can have these defined in the following ways:

enum MiscProperty
{
    Frightened
    LiftedAway,
    BlownAway,
    StatusImmune
}

In BattleEntity:

protected readonly Dictionary<MiscProperties, object> MiscProperties;

The value of the MiscProperties dictionary is an object because these properties aren't related.
It allows us to be as flexible as possible with them.

For example:

(Mario uses a Fright Mask on all enemies in battle)
The enemy's chance of running away would be:

int frightenedChance = (int)MiscProperties[MiscProperty.Frightened];

Similarly, we can check if an entity is StatusImmune in the following manner:

bool statusImmune = (bool)MiscProperties[MiscProperty.StatusImmune];

The Dictionary allows us to quickly and easily add new properties, remove existing ones, and access their values.

Add methods for adding properties, removing properties, accessing a property's value, and checking if a property exists.

---------------
Instead of an object as the value, create a new immutable struct called MiscValueHolder and use that as the value:

struct MiscValueHolder
{
    public int IntValue { get; private set; }
    public bool BoolValue { get; private set; }
    public string StringValue { get; private set; }
}

The problem with object as the value is there's no way to get a default value if the property doesn't exist, and it can
cause an InvalidCastException or NullReferenceException, both of which must be prevented by checking if the property
exists in the dictionary.

This is a pain, so to ease things, let's use MiscValueHolders as the value and return
an empty one with default values if a property doesn't exist in the dictionary. This
makes it easier to work with and allows us to have default values for each property.
