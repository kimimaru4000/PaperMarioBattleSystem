Double and Triple Dip Implementation (12/27/16)
-----------------------------------------------
Double and Triple Dip allow Mario (or his Partner with the P version) to use multiple items in one turn.

After using all the items, it counts as just one turn passed.

Double Dip
----------
-Double Dip allows two items in one turn
-The Double Dip Badge costs 1 BP and 3 FP to use in PM
-The Double Dip Badge costs 3 BP and 4 FP to use in TTYD

Triple Dip
----------
-Triple Dip allows three items in one turn
-The Triple Dip Badge costs 3 BP and 6 FP in PM
-The Triple Dip Badge is unused in TTYD. Instead, equipping two Double Dip Badges allows you to use Triple Dip
  -This means you can't have the option to use Triple Dip without having the Double Dip option
-In TTYD, Triple Dip costs 6 BP (3 BP for each Double Dip) and 8 FP to use

Functionality
-------------
As mentioned above, Double and Triple Dip allow you to use more than one item per turn.

If at least one item is used, the Item Menu shows up after the item is finished. Pressing B
brings up a dialogue asking if you want to stop using items. If "No" is selected, it goes back
to the Item Menu. If "Yes" is selected, it stops using items.

If either you stop using items or finish using them all, one turn passes. If you have the Fast
status, you will still get another turn, and you can use more items if desired.

Problems
--------
1. The main problem is getting the turn count implemented properly. Double/Triple Dip don't
technically give you more turns; they just let you use more items per turn.
2. We need to track the number of turns remaining for Double/Triple Dip.

Solutions
---------
2. We can have a new AdditionalProperty called DipTurns. This would have an int value that tells how many turns are remaining
for Double/Triple Dip. After each Double/Triple Dip usage, we will subtract one from this value.
If DipTurns is greater than or equal to 1, it will bring up the condensed menu with just the Item Menu instead of the entity's normal battle menu.

1. For this, we can do something similar to what Quick Change does. If DipTurns is greater than 1 after the item is used,
subtract 1 from the entity's used turn count. This will preserve the turn count while letting us use more items. When DipTurns
is 1, it won't subtract since that's the last item you can use.

This way of implementing this also lets us easily end the turn when the player chooses not to use another item.

Interference
------------
Confusion can interfere with Double/Triple Dip. If Mario or his Partner do something else due to Confusion when using
Double/Triple Dip, they do not get to use more items and their turn will end after they do the unintended move.
