Things To Test (3/9/17)
-----------------------
Here's a simple list of things to test in the first two Paper Mario games.

Pokey Parts
-----------
Which moves remove a Pokey part, and which other enemies have properties that act similar?
Stilt Guys might be worth looking into.

Results: 
-Shy Stacks act very similar and can have Shy Guys knocked off using Spin Smash or Kooper's Shell moves
-Super and Ultra Hammer also removes these parts
  -Knocking another enemy with one of these moves Pokey also removes a part. The same occurs with Spin Smash and Shy Stacks
-Kooper:
  -Shell Toss removes these parts
  -Power Shell removes these parts
  -Dizzy Shell doesn't remove any parts
  -Fire Shell removes these parts
-Koops:
  -Shell Toss removes these parts
  -Power Shell removes these parts
  -Shell Slam does NOT remove these parts
-If a Spike Top is Confused and attacks a Pokey, it WON'T remove a part
-Parakarry's Shell Shot doesn't remove a part
-A failed Spin Smash doesn't remove a part. A failed Super and Ultra Hammer also doesn't remove a part
  
Payback and Invincibility
--------------------------
How does Payback work with true invincibility? The Shadow Queen doesn't have any contact moves, so test on Bowser in PM.
Test with Zap Tap equipped and note the differences of when he stomps on you with and without his Star Rod powers in effect.
The Iron Clefts in TTYD don't take any Payback damage whatsoever, and Superguarding their attacks causes them to recoil back with no damage
instead of getting damaged and playing their hurt animation like other Clefts.

Since there's no Superguarding in PM, it looks like the only instance of Superguarding an invincible enemy is the Iron Clefts. Look for more
invincible enemies to make sure.

Results: (down below)

Without Star Rod
----------------
-Bowser stomps on Mario, then takes recoil damage and bounces off in a manner similar to when he uses his claw attack
-Most interesting of all, it DOESN'T inflict NoSkills and remove an ability for Mario, even though it wasn't Guarded

With Star Rod
-------------
-Bowser stomps on Mario, ignoring Zap Tap completely
-Like normal, it inflicts NoSkills and removes an ability for Mario

Invincibility and Debuffs
-------------------------
Does debuffing Bowser in PM with Chill Out cause him to have -3 attack when he reactivates his Star Rod powers again?

Result: No. Bowser's Star Rod powers immediately remove all Status Effects he's afflicted with.

Life Shrooms and NoSkills
-------------------------
Do Life Shrooms take effect if items are disabled with NoSkills?

Result: Yes, they do.

Healing Resistances and Invincibility
-------------------------------------
Do invincible enemies with a healing resistance still heal when you attack them with an element that heals them?
Test on Ice Puffs in TTYD with the Invincible attribute modifier code applied to them.

Result: No, since you deal no damage

Can Ms. Mowz steal stolen Coins, Items, or Badges from Bandits and Badge Bandits?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Result: Yes, she can steal Coins, Items, and Badges back!

Allergic and KO Statuses
------------------------
Does an enemy with Allergic prevent it from being KOed with Showstopper?

Result: Yes! Allergic prevents all Status Effects, including the ones inflicted by Fright Masks, Gale Force, and Showstopper.
All of these moves were tested numerous times on a Spiked Goomba afflicted with Allergic, and it wasn't affected by any of those statuses.

Bobbery's Bomb Squad
--------------------
Is Bomb Squad an Explosive or Fire move? Test if it does more damage to Ice enemies and if it flips Clefts and Bristles.

Results: Bomb Squad is an Explosive move. It deals more damage to Fiery enemies, but it does not flip Clefts and Bristles.

Flipping
--------

1. MarioWiki says that a Hyper Cleft in PM has 1 Defense when flipped, if that's true, then flipping decreases Defense by a certain amount,
not all of it. Confirm this.

2. In TTYD if Koops or an enemy that's flipped is inflicted with Fast, do they get up faster?

3. If Koops guards, does he prevent getting flipped?

Results:

1. Hyper Clefts have a Defense of 3. In TTYD, flipping Hyper Clefts sets their Defense to 0, and in PM it sets their Defense to 1.

2. Yes. Attempting to get up takes a single turn, and Fast allows them to get up in a single phase cycle since they have two turns.

3. Yes. Koops does not get flipped if he Guards or Superguards an attack that would flip him.

Flipping and Immobilized
------------------------
Does the counter increase for getting up the same turn Immobilized wears off on a Flipped character or the turn after?

Result: It increases on the same turn, just like how it's currently implemented.

For reference, I tested on a Spiked Goomba encounter and made sure only 1 Spiked Goomba was left. I had the Spiked Goomba flip Koops.
On Mario's turn I used a cheat to inflict Sleep on the Spiked Goomba and Immobilized Mario and Koops with Clock Out. After Immobilized
wore off, Koops got up, totaling 2 turns he was Flipped.

Additionally, if a Spiked Goomba attacks Koops when he is Immobilized, it resets his flipped turn count. This is great since this,
along with the above information, confirms that the current system is accurate.

Lastly, I noticed that Koops goes into his hurt animation instead of his flipped animation when Immobilized.

Flipping and Slow
-----------------
Does this work similarly to Immobilized, meaning only when Koops gets a chance to move does it progress the flipped counter?

Result: Yes

Winged enemies and Hammer
-------------------------
In PM, hitting a Paragoomba with a Hammer from a First Strike makes it lose its wings. Test the following cases:

1. Does this also happen in TTYD?
2. Do any normal Hammer moves cause it to lose its wings?
3. Does any damage at all cause it to lose its wings?

Results: (down below)

3. No; Bow's Smack didn't cause a Paragoomba to lose its wings.

Winged enemies and Immobilized
------------------------------
Do Paragoomba and Paratroopa wings stop moving when Immobilized? Test in both PM and TTYD, and check similar statuses like Sleep.

Results: (down below)

PM
--
Yes, they stop moving from Immobilized, however, they keep moving during Sleep as Paragoombas have their own Sleep animation.


Multiple Ice Smashes and Fire Enemies
-------------------------------------
Stacking Ice Smash adds 2 to the Frozen duration per badge equipped, but does it also increase the damage done to fire enemies?

Result: No


Strengths and Payback
---------------------
Does having Ice Power equipped increase the amount of Payback damage you take on Fiery enemies with Full or Half payback?

Result: Yes, meaning strengths are taken into account.
