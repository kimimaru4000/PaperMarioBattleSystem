TTYD Allergic Tests 7/25/16
---------------------------
Actual testing of how Allergic works in TTYD by getting Mario afflicted with Status Effects and using Space Food on him.

Space Food doesn't have a 100% chance of inflicting Allergic, so I used Triple Dip with both Mario and his Partner
to use multiple Space Foods in one turn.

For Status Effects that prevent Mario and his Partner from moving, such as Frozen, I had Feeling Fine P equipped so
the Partner would be able to use Space Food on Mario when he's afflicted with that Status Effect.

Additional Notes
----------------
-Allergic does not stop Happy Heart, Happy Flower, Pity Heart, or Pity Flower from taking effect
-Feeling Fine does not allow Electrified to be inflicted

-Fast, Slow, and No Skills are impossible for me to test right now because they are only used by bosses, all of which have already been
defeated in the save file I'm using. Based on these extreme results, it's safe to say that it will be possible to inflict Mario with Allergic
when they're active and that it'll be impossible to inflict any of them while Mario has Allergic. No Skills seems like it'd be an exception,
but I thought the same with Charged yet that worked the same as the other Status Effects.

Conclusion
----------
1. Allergic can be inflicted on Mario regardless of which Status Effects he has on him, aside from Allergic.
2. While Allergic and another Status Effect are on Mario, everything functions normally and the Status Effect
increments turns like normal.

Update (7/28/16)
----------------
Using cheat codes in Dolphin, I managed to test Slow and Fast, and found a functional Status Effect for the unused Status Effect icon in the game!

23. Slow -> Space Food

Result: Allergic afflicted

24. Fast -> Space Food

Result: Allergic afflicted

Notes
-----
-I was unable to find a code to inflict No Skills, but I realized that the Jumpman and Hammerman Badges likely do the same exact thing. While
equipped, you can inflict Allergic on yourself, so I think it's safe to say that it's possible to inflict Allergic over No Skills.

-When Fast and Slow were inflicted at the same time, Fast always overrode Slow. Despite Slow being inflicted and showing the icon, it acted as if Slow wasn't there and only did Fast.

-The unused Status Effect was referred to as "Fear" in the cheat code description and reduced Mario's Attack by at least 13. I couldn't find
out whether it did anything else or not.
