Frost Piranha

-Have a Heal Resistance to Ice
-No contact exception to Ice

Stilt Guys
----------
-Fall off when being inflicted with any type of Immobilized status, such as Paralyzed or Dizzy (in PM)
-Fall off when jumped on, turning into normal Shy Guys
-Also fall off when hit with Quake Hammer

Shy Squad
---------
-Counts as a single enemy
-Has 15 HP, with each Shy Guy representing 1 HP
  -When damaged, the number of Shy Guys correlating to the amount of damage are removed from the squad (Ex. 4 damage means 4 Shy Guys are removed)
-Number of times they attack correlates to how many there are in the Squad (Max = 15, Min = 1)

Shy Stack
---------
-Counts as a single enemy
-All Shy Guys share and use the same animations simultaneously
-Battle position is the topmost Shy Guy
-Attack power correlates to how many there are on the stack (Max Attack = 4, Min Attack = 1)
-Can knock off the bottom-most Shy Guy with Spin Smash. If successful, will knock off the one it hits into as well
-Can also knock off the bottom-most Shy Guy with Kooper's Shell moves
-If all but one are knocked off, still act like a Shy Stack and deal 1 damage

Cleft
-----
-Flipped over with an explosion (TTYD) for 2 turns. When flipped, Defense goes to 0. After the turns are up, it gets back up
  -Its base Defense likely stays the same and its Defense modifier is subtracted by its base Defense to equal 0. Defense-boosting
   and Defense-lowering effects still apply while it's flipped
-Explosive Payback with Hold Fast does not cause them to flip over

Bristle
-------
-Pops its spikes out when approached with a move. Moves include Hammer, Gulp, or anything that gets near.
-Having Spike Shield equipped allows Mario to approach them with Hammer
-Flipped over with an explosion. Spikes on the bottom still protect it from jumps, and spikes on the side still prevent it from being approached
  -Also flipped over with Quake Hammer and a POW Block
  -However, an Earth Quake does NOT flip them over
-Not flipped with Explosive Payback via Hold Fast
-When Immobilized, spikes don't pop out, allowing them to be approached
  -Same with Frozen and Sleep
  -Interestingly, same with Confusion and Dizzy!
-When their spikes don't pop out due to immobilization or similar status effects, they're still spiky, as Ms. Mowz' Kiss Thief won't work but
 Mario's Hammer and Yoshi's Gulp do
-Asleep for 5 turns
-Like jumping on spiked enemies, their side spikes will still damage you if you're Invisible
-Koops can attack them without their spikes interrupting him with his shell moves

Paragoomba
----------
-In PM, loses wings when hit with the Hammer from a First Strike

Flipped Enemies (Koopa Troopas, Clefts, Bristles)
-------------------------------------------------
-They are immune to Fright when flipped, as they can't run away

Electro Blooper
---------------
-When it electrifies itself, it doesn't gain the Electrified status but directly applies the Electrified physical attribute instead
-Any move that damages it gets rid of its Electrified physical attribute when it electrifies itself

Lakitu
------
-When inflicted with Dizzy in TTYD, they drop any Spiny Eggs they're holding

Lava Piranha
------------
When it misses with its main fireball move, the fireball doesn't show up and little fire particles show up instead.

Huff N' Puff
------------
When he misses with his damaging air move where he blows at you, you're not required to perform the Action Command involving mashing A.

Yux, Z-Yux, X-Yux
----------------- 
They can still take damage from Status Effects such as Poison, Burn, and Frozen if they have a shield up.

Creating a Mini is a BattleEvent that occurs after all Status Effect-related BattleEvents at the start of the phase cycle.

If they don't move for a turn (via Immobilized, Slow, or another Status Effect that prevents movement), they will not create a Mini at the start of the phase cycle.
This means that performing a move on their turn causes the BattleEvent to occur.

Gulpits' Rocks
--------------
-Have 1 HP; dealing 0 damage on them doesn't have any effect
-They don't display their HP even after being Tattled or if the Peekaboo Badge is equipped

-Can't be targeted by multi-hit moves and items, and they aren't hit/affected by them either
-Can't be targeted by any single-hit item (Ex. Egg Missile)

-Can't be targeted by Air Lift
-Can't be targeted by Smack or Fan Smack
-Can't be targeted by Electro Dash or Power Shock
-Can't be targeted by Squirt
-Can't be targeted by Spiny Flip
-Can't be targeted by Hammer Throw

-Spin Smash can't destroy the rocks with the Action Command, and the rocks don't get knocked into each other like enemies do.
Hitting a rock with a failed Spin Smash causes it to spin and get destroyed.
