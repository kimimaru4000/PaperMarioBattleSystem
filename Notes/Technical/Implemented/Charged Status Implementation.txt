Charged Status Implementation (11/20/16)
----------------------------------------
The Charged Status Effect increases the power of your next attack and is stackable.

It persists until the BattleEntity inflicted with it dies or uses an attack to expend
the charge.

Excluding Moves From Charged
----------------------------
I tested in TTYD and found two attacks that deal damage but don't use the extra damage from Charged.

They are:
-Yoshi's Mini-Egg
-Bobbery's Bomb Squad

Why are they excluded? I'm not really sure.

What they have in common is their damage sources are indirect. Bomb Squad involves little bombs that
deal damage a few turns later, and Mini-Egg involves Yoshi throwing eggs to deal damage.

However, Vivian's Fiery Jinx is indirect as well and uses the extra damage from Charged.

My guess is that the way Mini-Egg and Bomb Squad were implemented didn't allow them to use
Charged's bonus damage, or just the designers didn't want those attacks using Charged for whatever reason.

Either way, we'll need to come up with a way to exclude certain moves from being able to use the extra
damage and expend the charge in the implementation.

Problems
--------
1. The immediate problem that comes to mind is deciding when to expend the charge.

It has to be at the end of the BattleEntity's turn as that's when actions end. However, how do we
decide whether an action can use and expend the Charge?

2. All Status Effects last a certain duration, but Charged lasts until death or an action that uses the charge
is completed. There's no way to obtain a specific StatusEffect on an entity because they manage themselves, so
there would be no way to end Charged until the end of the phase cycle. Charged is the only StatusEffect like this
in the entire PM series.

3. Status Effects are refreshed when inflicted more than once on a BattleEntity, so how would we stack Charged?

Solutions
---------
1. Both using the bonus damage and expending the charge go hand-in-hand, so there should be a single bool
in MoveActionData called UsesCharge. This would give us max flexibility regarding which MoveActions can
use and expend the charge and which ones don't. For example, this will allow us to create an Item that can be influenced
by the Charged status.

We'll just have to be careful when creating the actions to ensure that the charge
isn't expended for actions that shouldn't expend it (Ex. Changing Partners).

2. All StatusEffects are removed on death, so that case isn't an issue. We can have Charged always have a duration
of 0 so it lasts forever. After a MoveAction where UsesCharge is true ended, we can check for Charged and remove it
if the entity has it.

3. We can use a MiscProperty called ChargedDamage, which will be controlled by the Charged status. When Charged
is afflicted or refreshed, we will add to ChargedDamage with the values passed in and completely remove the
MiscProperty when Charged ends, which is when it is removed by the MoveAction.
