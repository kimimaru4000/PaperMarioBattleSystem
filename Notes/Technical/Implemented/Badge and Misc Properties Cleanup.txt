Badge and Misc Properties Cleanup (12/22/16)
--------------------------------------------
The original goal of tying in Badges and MiscProperties was so these values can be
manipulated through other means, making them more flexible. However, we never change
these values through other means and I feel they've been making things more messy overall.

Solutions
---------
1. Rename MiscProperties to AdditionalProperties
    -Considering how many MiscProperties are used regularly, this a better name
2. Check for Badge counts for Badge-specific properties
    -All the properties involving Badges right now rely on the Badge count
3. Remove GlobalPlayerProperties
    -These are redundant and further add to the mess, considering they also use Badge counts
